                    When the “Who’s your favorite international blogger?” question pops out, everyone would state random names of well-known bloggers or even call them by their personal Instagram handles. In the Philippines, @SongofStyle has been the most suggested international fashion bloggers. Behind the title “Song of Style” is Aimee Song, the girl everybody wants to dress like. </p>

                    <p>Aimee Song has been one of the first fashion bloggers worldwide. She started at the year 2008 and since that time, her Song of Style has risen to the game changer status, thanks to her knack for creating bold but laid back outfits. Her sense of fashion and her life is every girls dream. Traveling from one place to another, being able to achieve the ultimate feed goals on IG, slaying every outfit she wears, being featured in topnotch worldwide magazines, having front-row seats in the most exclusive fashion shows/events and being part of Forbes’ “30 Under 30” list for 2016, her life is a dream. With all that’s been said, luxury and fame doesn’t affect her humble and down to earth personality which makes people love her even more. </p>

                    <p>Moving on to her personal style, she takes laid back to a whole new level, with casual ensembles to being prim and proper, she makes every getup stand out effortlessly, even the most simplest ones. Just like Aimee, I have a fetish for lazy/laid back dressing, and in this blog I have 5 top style picks from her gallery that I love the most..</p>

                   

                    <h2 class="section-heading">OFF SHOULDER MADNESS</h2>

                    <p>One of Aimee's favorites is the off shoulder top. I love how casual her getups are and yet she seems to pull of that classy vibe.  This is a proof that one top can make a statement and complete an outfit. You have to choose the best one for you whether this may be cropped tops or shirts, you should know your personal style and what suits you well. </p>

                    <p>In Aimee’s case, her off shoulder top give emphasis to her neck and shoulders, giving her a pleasing romantic silhouette. The style of the top is also crucial, choose a specific top that would compliment your style</p>

                    

                    <h2 class="section-heading">DRESSY SENSATION</h2>
                    
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/song3.png" >

                    <p>Aimee has a collection of unique and well-detailed dresses. Just like her off shoulder tops, her love for dreamy dresses is obviously seen through her Instagram posts and Vlogs as well. Choosing a good dress also depends on your body type, you have to do trial and error. Aimee has a slim body, therefore the ruffles of her dresses (on the photos above) makes her body more in shape.</p>

                    <P>In my case, I have a thick figure which means ruffles would make me look wider, that’s why I always go for bodycon and minimal dresses to give emphasis on my shape. </P>

                    
                    </a>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">PRIM & PROPER</h2>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/song2.png" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>Taking laid back to a whole new level, Aimee song gives you a relaxed classy take on a formal event with the usual off shoulder cuts with a long back statement. Who said jeans/trousers can't be as classy as this? Finished it all up with sexy stilettos. Being prim and proper doesn't require you luxurious designer dresses. Aimee has pulled of this look effortlessly!</p>

                     </a>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">CASUAL CALIFORNIAN</h2>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/song4.png" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>Aimee has slayed the Californian Street style dressing ever since. Despite of the heat, she plays well with basics and she sure has an eye for details.</p>

                    <p>Tip: when choosing clothes, look for good basics but don’t forget about detail.</p>

                      </a>
                    <h2 class="section-heading">CHROMATIC CRAZE</h2>
                    <a href="#">
                        <img class="img-responsive" src="img/song5.png" alt="">
                    </a>

                    <p>Anything chromatic doesn’t attract me at all. I am not a fan of vibrant colors but seeing Aimee’s ensembles makes me wan’t to try on her clothes even if it isn’t black! Colors are one way to distract people from thinking that you’re a lazy ass to wear something more proper, it gives a cheerful vibe as well. 

                    “My blog represents who I am, fun, easy going, and colorful, a mix and match of styles with underlying California roots,” she has said in a previous interview. Her personal qualities makes her fit to become SM’s new face.</p>
